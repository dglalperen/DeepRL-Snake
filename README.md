# Deep Neural Network for Snake Game using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on training a Deep Neural Network to play the snake game using reinforcement learning techniques. The primary aim is to make the snake learn how to navigate the environment to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the wall or itself.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or greater
- Pytorch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pygame
- IPython
